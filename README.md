The various jupyter notebooks are our work up until we switched over to using Magenta. They do various things such as converting MIDIs to XML or CSV format, attempting to use the Keras LSTM, and downloading and displaying Bach scores.

The two Magenta scripts are what generated results. The magenta_script.sh performs the training while the magenta_generate.sh generates music. Magenta must be installed to run these scripts. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/blob/master/README.md) to install Magenta.
